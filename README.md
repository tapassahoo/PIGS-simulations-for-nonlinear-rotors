# A List of simulations has been performed for the estimation of **ground state** properties for many nonlinear rotors systems.

:one: A list of simulations for **water molecules**

The following parameters has been used for all simulations -
 
```
R    = 10.05 Angstrom
		
# of Blocks = 20,0000
# of Pass   = 100
```

Rotational constants are - 
   A = 27.877 cm <sup>-1</sup>,
   B = 14.512 cm <sup>-1</sup>,
   C = 9.285 cm <sup>-1</sup>,

- [x] Simulations at **fixed tau = 0.01 K<sup>-1</sup>** for **N=2**

   ```
   Type of potential: TIP4-GG
   ```

   _The list of beads P is_
    
   ```
   P    = [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]
