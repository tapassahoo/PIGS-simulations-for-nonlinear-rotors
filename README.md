# A List of simulations has been performed for the estimation of **ground state** properties for many nonlinear rotors systems.

List of simulations by using Path Integral Monte Carlo for the estimation of thermodynamic properties of N number of rotors placed in a linear chain.  The following parameters has been used for all simulations -
 
Rotational A, B and C constants are 27.877 cm<sup>-1</sup>  14.512<sup>-1</sup>  9.285<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
